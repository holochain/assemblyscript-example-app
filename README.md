# assemblyscript-example-app

Example of running an app using a Rust based holochain container.

Install [holochain-cmd](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-cmd), and also Rust (with Cargo). Both are expected in your path for `./build-and-test.sh` to run.

In a CLI:

go to directory `zomes/three/capabilities/main/code`

run `npm install`

go to main directory

run `./build-and-test.sh`
